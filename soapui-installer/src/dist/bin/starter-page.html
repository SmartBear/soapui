         <p class="style1">You're getting this message since your computer is offline and SoapUI can't access Internet.
         Without Internet connection you might experience some issues when doing Web Service Testing.</p>
         <p class="style1">Usually this is where you would see the SoapUI starter page which includes the latest news
         and other relevant information.</p>
         <p class="style1">Make sure to connect to Internet to get access to all services and information from SmartBear.</p>
         <p class="style1">Thanks!<br>The SmartBear Sweden Team</p></td>
