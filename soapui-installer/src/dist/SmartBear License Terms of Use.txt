Accordingly, any use, duplication or disclosure by the Federal Government or any of its authorized users is subject to restrictions as set forth in this standard license agreement for the Software. If for any reason, Sections 12.212, 227.7202-1 or 227.7202-3 are deemed not applicable, then the Federal Government’s rights to use, duplicate or disclose the Software are limited to "Restricted Rights" as defined in 48 CFR Section 52.227-19(c)(1) and (2) (June 1987), or DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(14) (June 1995), as applicable. If this Agreement fails to meet the Federal Government’s needs or is inconsistent in any respect with Federal law, the Federal Government agrees to return the Software, unused, to SmartBear. Manufacturer is SmartBear Software Inc., 450 Artisan Way, Somerville, MA 02145.
