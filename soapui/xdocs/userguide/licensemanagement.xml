		<section name="SoapUI Pro License Management">
		<p>soapUI Pro license management is straightforward; when starting soapUI the first time, or when the 
		license has expired, the following dialog will prompt for a new License:</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/license_1.gif" alt="SoapUI Pro License Dialog"/></p>
		<p>Selecting either the "Apply for Trial" or "Buy License" buttons will open Web Pages the will let you get the right licenses in an 
		external browser.</p>
		<p>Choosing to cancel the dialog without already having a valid license installed will prompt to run soapUI in 
		"Guest" mode, which has all Pro related features disabled but can still be fully used as a soapUI 
		standalone installation.</p>
		<p>After specifying a valid file, you will be prompted to accept the soapUI license agreement and a 
		confirmation dialog will be shown:</p>

		<columns><column><div>This dialog can always be opened from the "Help/Show License Details" main menu 
		option. A license can also be updated manually with the "Help/Update License" option which will restart 
		the above process. </div> <!-- @TODO@explain Option for bye license? -->

		<subsection name="Command Line, Plugins and Licenses">
		<p>None of the command line runners will require a license to run. The associated Tool or IDE plug-ins will 
		be released in pro enabled versions shortly after the stand alone soapUI Pro release.
