		<section name="JDBC Request Steps">

            <p>JDBC Request Steps are standalone JDBC requests that can be used to submit SQL query and get the result in XML format. They are added
                via the  TestCase Editors popup menu with the "Add Step -&gt; JDBC Request" option.</p>

                     <subsection name="JDBC Test Request Details Tab">
                      <p>
                    The "Details" tab shown in the bottom-left shows standard Name and Description of particular TestStep, and introduces two more properties
                    <li>Max Rows</li>
                    <li>Query Timeout</li>
                    </p>
                    </subsection>

                     <subsection name="The JDBC Test Request Editor">
                     <p>Double-clicking a JDBC Test Request in either the navigator or the TestCase Editor Pane opens the requests
                     editor which is split into two parts</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>The first part is standard properties table layout which contains properties to be replaced in SQL query through
                         PreparedStatement </li>
                         </ul>
                                     <p align="center"><img src="images/jdbc_request_step_properties.gif"></img></p>

                      <ul>
                         <li>The second part contains connection details, SQL query and information if it's a stored procedure or not.</li>
                         </ul>
                                     <p align="center"><img src="images/jdbc_request_step_config.gif"></img></p>

                    <p>In SoapUI Pro there is additional option of using Database connection set on project level(see 
                    <a href="../projects/jdbcConnections.html">Project JDBC Connections</a>) and generating SQL query using a wizard (see 
                    <a href="../projects/jdbcConnections.html">SQL Query wizards</a>)
                    </p>
                    </subsection>
                    <subsection name="The JDBC Test Request Response View">
                    <p>
                    Response view has standard XML and Outline tabs, and it's content can be asserted in a standard way(
                    see <a href="response-assertions.html">Test Request Assertions</a> for more detailed information about assertions)
                    </p>
                    </subsection>
