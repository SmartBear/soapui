		<subsection name="Transfer From Wizard">
		<p>This wizard is available in the TestRequest Request Message Editor and the MockResponse Response editor.
		Right-click the node in the Request Outline View which you want to transfer to, the following popup 
		menu will be displayed:</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/transfer_from_popup.gif" alt="Wizard for transfering data from source to target"/></p>
		<p>The popup displays all TestSteps with their readable properties in a submenu. If the step is a Properties 
		Step a "Create New" option will be displayed at the bottom. There are 4 ways to continue;</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Select an existing source property, if the selected property contains an XML Value, the 
		<a href="../xpath_selector.html">XPath Selector</a> will be shown to create the source XPath expression for the transfer.</li>
		<li>Select the "Create New" option for a Properties Step which will prompt for a property name</li>
		<li>Select the "Add Properties Step" option which will prompt for both a Properties Step name and a property name</li>
		<li>Select the "Property" option</li>
		</ol>
		<p>All of these option will eventually open the "Transfer from Property" dialog:</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/transfer_from_dialog.gif" alt="Transfer from dialog"/></p>
		<p>The dialog will be filled out depending on which option that was chosen; any of the first three options
		will result in a complete dialog that can be finished with the OK button without further input. The dialogs'
		first tab has the following options:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Source Property - the source property to transfer from, contains the selected property if possible</li>
		<li>Source Step - the step containing the source property, contains the selected step if possible</li>
		<li>Create Property Expansion - creates <a href="../properties.html#Property_Expansion">Property Expansion</a> for transferring
		the property instead of a property transfer. Selecting this option disables all following options.</li>
		<li>Transfer Name - the name of the created transfer in the selected Property Transfer Step, preset with the name
		of the selected node if possible</li>
		<li>Property Transfer - the property transfer step to create the transfer in, preset to the first available transfer 
		before the current Request Step. If no such step is available, soapUI will prompt for the name of the step to be
		created when finishing the dialog.</li>
		<li>Open Editor - opens the Property Transfer editor for the containing Property Transfer step after creation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The remaining Source XPath and Target XPath tabs contain editors for there corresponding XPath expression together
		with an option to use the XPath Selector to set this value.</p>
		<p>When closing the dialog, the corresponding Property Transfer or Property Expansion will be created as specified in 
		the dialog. In the above example, selecting the "Create Property Expansion" option and pressing OK created the following
		syntax in our request;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/transfer_from_dialog_result.gif"  alt="Property Expansion as a result of a Transfer From Wizard"/></p>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Transfer To Wizard">
		<p>This wizard corresponds to the above and creates a Property Transfer from the selected node to a target node.
		It is available in the TestRequest Response Outline Editor and the MockResponse Request Editor. Right clicking 
		the desired source node will show the following popup menu:</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="images/transfer_to_popup.gif" alt="Wizard for transfering data to target to source"/></p>
		<p>The popup displays all TestSteps with their writable properties in a submenu. If the step is a Properties 
		Step a "Create New" option will be displayed at the bottom. There are 4 ways to continue;</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Select an existing target property, if the selected property contains an XML Value, the 
		<a href="../xpath_selector.html">XPath Selector</a> will be shown to create the target XPath expression for the transfer.</li>
		<li>Select the "Create New" option for a Properties Step which will prompt for a property name</li>
		<li>Select the "Add Properties Step" option which will prompt for both a Properties Step name and a property name</li>
		<li>Select the "Property" option</li>
		</ol>
		<p>All of these option will eventually open the "Transfer to Property" dialog:</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/transfer_to_dialog.gif" alt="Transfer to dialog"/></p>
		<p>The dialog will be filled out depending on which option that was chosen; any of the first three options
		will result in a complete dialog that can be finished with the OK button without further input. The dialogs'
		first tab has the following options:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Target Step</b> - the step containing the target property, contains the selected step if possible</li>
		<li><b>Target Property</b> - the target property to transfer to, contains the selected property if possible</li>
		<li><b>Transfer Name</b> - the name of the created transfer in the selected Property Transfer Step, preset with the name
		of the selected node if possible</li>
		<li><b>Property Transfer</b> - the property transfer step to create the transfer in, preset to the first available transfer 
		after the current Request Step. If no such step is available, soapUI will prompt for the name of the step to be
		created when finishing the dialog.</li>
		<li><b>Open Editor</b> - opens the Property Transfer editor for the containing Property Transfer step after creation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The remaining Target XPath and Source XPath tabs contain editors for there corresponding XPath expression together
		with an option to use the XPath Selector to set this value.</p>
		<p>Finishing the dialog will create a property transfer as specified and optionally open the Property Transfer 
		editor containing the created transfer</p>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Add XPath Assertion Wizard">
		<p>This wizard can be used to quickly create XPath assertions for either TestRequest response messages or MockResponse
		request messages. The wizard is available from either messages Outline Editor as follows;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/xpath_wizard_popup.gif" alt="Add XPath Assertion Wizard in soapUI Pro"/></p>
		<p>Selecting one of the available XPath assertion types will create a XPath Match assertion with the corresponding
		XPath expression and expected value, for example for the above when selecting "for Count", the following dialog is shown;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/xpath_wizard_dialog.gif"  alt="Add XPath Assertion dialog in soapUI Pro"/></p>
		<p>The dialog has all fields filled out based on the selected node and its value. Here one can modify the XPath 
		expression further and/or save/cancel the creation with the corresponding Save/Cancel buttons</p>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Add Script Assertion Wizard">
		<p>This wizard can be used to quickly create Script assertions for TestRequest response messages. 
		It's available from Outline Editor as follows;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/script_wizard_popup.gif" alt="Add Script Assertion Wizard in soapUI Pro"/></p>
		<p>Selecting "for Existence with Script" will create a Script assertion, for example for the above the following dialog is shown;</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="images/script_wizard_dialog.gif"  alt="Add Script Assertion dialog in soapUI Pro"/></p>
