		<section name="Resolving Project Items">
		<p>When importing an existing Project, TestSuite or TestCase, soapUI will automatically check the imported items
        for consistancy regarding file-references, etc. (This can also be triggered manually from the Project popup menu).
        If there are resolve errors (for example if a referenced file is missing), a Resolve dialog is shown as follows:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/resolve-dialog.gif"></img></p>
        <p>The dialog contains a table with the following columns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Item - the Model Item that has an unresolved property/settings/value</li>
                    <li>Description- a description of the resolve error</li>
                    <li>Value - the value that failed to resolve</li>
                    <li>Action - a drop-down containing actions that can be taken to resolve the item; perform the
                    desired action to resolve the error</li>
                </ul>
            <p>

            If a resolve action potentially resolved several other items use the Update button to re-resolve the project.
                Closing the Resolve dialog if there are still unresolved item will prompt to leave them as they are.
