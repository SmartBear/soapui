		<section name="REST Methods in soapUI">
		<p>A REST Method in soapUI correspond roughly to a Method in WADL and is contained as a child to a REST Resource. 
		It defines which HTTP Method, Parameters, Representations, etc are available to a child Request.
        Methods are created from the "New Method" Resource popup which prompts for an initial name, HTTP Method and
        if to open the method editor:</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/new-rest-method.gif"></img></p>

        <p>soapUI has built in support for visualizing both JSON and XML responses, and also internally converts HTML and JSON
        responses to XML so they can be used in functional tests together with other related features (property-transfers,
        xpath assertions, etc).</p>    
        
            <subsection name="REST Method Viewer">
                <p>The REST Method View is as follows:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/method-editor.gif"></img></p>
                <p>The toolbar at the top contains an action to create a new request for this Method together
                with a combo box to edit the HTTP method of the Method. The "Method Parameters" tab contains
                all parameters for this Method and the "Representations" tab contains all representations, 
                both as described in <a href="params.html">Parameters and Representations</a></p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="Properties and Actions">
