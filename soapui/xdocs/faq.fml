      <question>
        <b>When should I use soapUI?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>When you are developing/discovering Web Service clients or implementations and need a tool to test them 
      interactively and/or create functional and load-tests that can be run in a continuous integration environment.</p>

    <faq id="general2">
      <question>
        <b>What can I not do with soapUI?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>Some of the more obvious missing features are WSDL authoring WS-Security support. Check out
      the <a href="future.html">Future Plans</a> document to see what's missing (for now).</p>

    <faq id="general3">
      <question>
        <b>Does soapUI work with any Web Service technology?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>soapUI is platform agnostic, you can use it for Web Services created with .NET, J2EE, Perl, PHP, etc. The
			only requirements on your Web Service are that they have a defining WSDL, that they are bound with the SOAP/HTTP binding,  
			and that they do not use SOAP-Encoding (if you want to do validations).</p>

       <question>
        <b>Why would I use the Java WebStart distribution?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>Because it is easier to install and update. You won't have to download new versions and bug-fixes, the
         Java WebStart runtime does that for you. Also, minor updates/fixes will be added to the WebStart distribution
         continuously, whereas the "offline" distribution will be updated at "relevant" intervals.</p>

 <faq id="dist2">
      
       <question>
        <b>Are there any differences between the Java WebStart distribution and the standalone distribution?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>There are some differences:
         <ul>
         	<li>The standalone distribution allows you to specify the <a href="userguide/projects.html">workspace file</a> as 
         	a command-line argument to soapUI</li>
         	<li>The WebStart classloader handling will prevent you from performing sandboxed operations from within your Groovy scripts</li>
         </ul>
         
         </p>
      </answer>

    <faq id="dist3">
      
       <question>
        <b>Does the Java WebStart distribution require me to be online when I want to use soapUI?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>No, soapUI can run in offline mode. You may need to setup a start-icon for soapUI though (using the 
         Java control panel).</p>

       <question>
        <b>How do I save the changes I make to my projects, requests, TestCases, etc?</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>soapUI automatically saves everything upon exit. If you want to save your projects without 
         exiting (for example if you want to commit your project file to CVS) use the "Save All" option in 
         the main File menu</p>

       <question>
        <b>I have updated my XML Schema for my service but soapUI still generates/validates according to the 
        old schema</b>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <p>soapUI caches XML schemas when they are first loaded. If you need to force a reload of an interfaces
         schema either restart soapUI or use the "Update Definition" action for an interface and just specify the 
         same URL as the current one.</p>
