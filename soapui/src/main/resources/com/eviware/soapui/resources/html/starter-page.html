            <p class="style1">You're getting this message since your computer is offline and SoapUI can't access
                Internet.
                Without Internet connection you might experience some issues when doing Web Service Testing.</p>

            <p class="style1">Usually this is where you would see the SoapUI starter page which includes the latest news
                and other relevant information.</p>

            <p class="style1">Make sure to connect to Internet to get access to all services and information from
                SmartBear.</p>

            <p class="style1">Thanks!<br>The SmartBear Sweden Team</p></td>
