# SoapUI Open Source 5.2.1

#### Released 2015-10-02 ####

* More efficient memory usage. (SOAPUIOS-154)

* A new feature by Stanislaw Wozniak (a GitHub user with the nickname sponte): The test runner has a new setting that commands SoapUI to export test case properties to JUnit-style reports. You can find the new “Export JUnit Results with test properties” check box on the Reports tab of the dialog, in which you specify the test runner's properties before the run. To enable this functionality from the command line, use the new -J command-line argument. (SOAPUIOS-156)

# SoapUI Open Source 5.2

#### Released 2015-07-02 ####

### Major New Features ###

* You can use 4 new JSONPath-based assertions:
   - JsonPath Count           - Calculates the number of element occurrences in a JSON response.
   - JsonPath Existence Match - Extracts data from a JSON response and compares it with an expected value.
   - JsonPath Match           - Checks if a JSON response contains specific node.
   - JsonPath RegEx Match     - Extracts data from a JSON response and verifies it with a regular expression.
  You can find the new assertions in the Add Assertions dialog, in the Property Content assertion group.
* You can create new empty projects (in earlier versions, projects had to be based on WSDL or WADL, or URI).

### Improvements ###

* New look inspired by ReadyAPI.
* Support for Java 6 has been dropped. 
  To run SoapUI, now you need to have Java 7 on your computer.

  so if you use the installer, you do not have to download and install additional files.
* Old-style icons have been replaced with newer icons.

### Bundled Plugins ###

The SoapUI installation package includes the following plugins:

* In the Property Transfer test step editor, it was possible to add two items with the same name to the Transfers list.
* When you resized the "Contain" assertion edit window, the text in that window did not resize appropriately.
* The Overview tab of the REST Interface editor displayed "WSDL Definition" instead of "WADL Definition".
* There was a misprint in the SoapUI Preferences > WSDL Settings screen.

2007-02-09 : 1.7 beta1 release

We are happy to release this intermediate version with several key improvements to SoapUI functionality.
        
* Support for Mocking of WebServices from within SoapUI. Mock Services can be run either from inside SoapUI
or with one of the IDE/Maven/CommandLine plugins.This opens for a number of usage scenarios, including:
- Rapid Prototyping of WebServices; generate a complete static mock implementation from a WSDL in seconds 
and add dynamic functionality using Groovy.
- Client testing/development; create mock implementations of desired operations set up a number of 
sample responses (including attachments and custom http-headers) so clients can be developed/tested without 
access to the "live" services. Responses can be cycled, randomized or selected with XPath expression from 
incoming request
- Test-Driven Development; Create SoapUI TestSuites/TestCases against MockServices before/during the actual
services have been/are being implemented
* New/Improved Tool Integrations for JBossWS "wsimport" and Oracle wsa
* Improved WSDL-inspector shows tree/outline view over complete contract with "drill-down" functionality
* SSL-inspection shows peer certifacte information for responses received using https
* Generate TestSuite action to generate a complete TestSuite for all operation in an interface
* Improved property-expansion allows XPath expression directly in property-expansion syntax
* New Not-SOAP-Fault assertion
* Possibility to expand received MTOM attachments for schema compliance
* Possibility to override attachment Content-IDs
* Possibility to add default schemas for validation
* Possibility to run WS-I validations using commandline tools
* Possibility to set log-tabs history
* Many more minor improvements and bug-fixes

As always, please make backups of your project files before testing and let us know if you have any issues!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-12 : 1.6 final release

We are extremely happy to finally release SoapUI 1.6 final which introduces a large number of
fixes and many minor improvements since the beta2 release, including;

* Added exclusion list to proxy settings (comma-seperated)
* Added 2 context properties available when load-testing:
- ThreadIndex : the index of the created thread... this value will never change for a given TestCase during its run time.. 
New threads will simply get an incremented index... the mod of this value could for example be used as an index into a data-file 
(to handle changes in number of threads) 
- RunCount: tells how many times the TestCase has been run by its thread (not in total) during the current LoadTest 
* Added initial support for unzipping gzipped response messages, ie messages with a Content-Type or Content-Encoding ending with "gzip". 
Thanks to Diego Banda.
* Added request-level property to inline attachment content in response editor (as in SoapUI 1.5)
* Improved saving of projects to not corrupt files on out-of-memory (saving now first saves to an in-memory buffer
which is written to file if no errors occur..)
* Fixed validation of derived types in xml-editors
* Fixed automatic adding of TestStep Status assertion to newly created loadtests,
* Added option to ignore case in Contains/NotContains assertions
* Improved support for automatic validation by adding an option to not send invalid requests 
* Added support for automatic validation of request/response messages in editors  
thanks to Michael Vorburger! ("Preferences / UI Settings / Validate Request / Response")
* Added support for generating rpc-parts for attachments ("Preferences / WSDL Settings / Attachment Parts")
* Added [Tools] button to all Tools dialogs which opens "Preferences / Integrated Tools" for setting tool paths
* General dialog improvements; Escape closes and F1 shows online help if available
* Fixed validation of SOAP mustUnderstand/encodingStyle attributes in entire messages
* Added possibility to edit response message and revalidate with Alt-V (including assertions)
* Added possibility for custom background image in desktop. Just place a soapui-background.gif/jpg/png in the 
SoapUI bin directory (at last :-), Thanks to Roger Sundberg
* Added option to open TestCase editor when adding requests to a TestCase
* Updated to commons-ssl-0.3.0.jar
* Fixed caching of attachments to now be saved in the soapui-project file (compressed)... this makes
portability of soapui-projects with attachments much simpler... The attachment-folder setting has been
removed.
* Fixed property-expansion when running xpath-assertions and property-transfers from within their
editors.
* Fixes password-input fields to be masked

project-files, etc. so these can be fixed as soon as possible. Thanks!

Get started by running one of the SoapUI scripts in the bin folder..

Good Luck and happy soaping!
