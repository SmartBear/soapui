		<p>soapUI Pro adds a tabbed desktop as commonly available in other tools and IDE's. The layout is activated from 
		the <a href="preferences.html#UI_Settings">UI Settings Tab</a> in the soapUI global preferences dialog; select
		"Tabbed" from the Desktop Type combo box.</p>
		<p>Opened windows are displayed in tabs that can easily be</p>
		<ul>
		<li>dragged and arranged into multiple tab groups. Each tab-group has a top-right menu for tab-group related actions.</li>
		<li>docked and undocked from the desktop into separate windows (handy with multiple monitors) - from the tabs
		right-click menu. Tab-Groups can likewise be docked/undocked from the Tab-Groups top-right menu.</li>
		<li>"glued" or minimized to any side of the desktop, which can come in handy for windows that need to 
		be open but are not always in focus, for example MockService windows, TestCase runners, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The tab right-click menu has a number of options for performing some of the above tasks and for changing
		tab orientation/directions.</p>
		<p>For example the following screenshot shows a layout where the TestCase window has been dragged to
		the left and an associated LoadTest to the right. The 2 load-test diagrams have been dragged to the bottom.</p>
