		<p>The soapUI eclipse plugin provides full soapUI functionality from within eclipse. Apart from "standard" 
		soapUI 2.5 functionality, the eclipse plugin contains a soapUI project nature and also adds a new soapUI 
		perspective which mimics the layout of the standalone soapUI version.The plugin makes use of the 
		SWT_AWT bridge which greatly eases our development effort but may result in graphical glitches with dialogs 
		and some window updates... but all core functionality should be working	OK (let us know otherwise)...</p>
		<p>Currently the eclipse plugin can be downloaded from 
		<a target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=136013">soapUI SourceForge Download Page</a> or 
		through the update site located at http://www.soapui.org/eclipse/update/site.xml (see below)</p>
		<p>Please <a target="_new" href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/Web_Links-index-req-ratelink-lid-583.html">vote for this plugin</a> 
		at the <a target="_new" href="http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com">eclipse plugin central</a>.</p>
